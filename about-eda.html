    <h3>Who are you to give me advice?</h3>
    <p>
        I've had a high GPA so far (at the time I'm writing this, I am a rising senior) - 3.9 (APES was though, okay?).
        I also led a club or two. <br> 
        Am I successful? Maybe. Am I observant and do I think critically? Yes, I believe so.</p>

    <h3>Why do you add "Eda's" in front of everything?</h3>
    <p>To let you know what parts of this website I wrote (ex. APES finals site isn't mine), to show you that I am also a student here and these are generally my opinions. Opinions that I’ve reflected and thought upon for years, for that matter. It’s not because I’m a narcissist I promise. </p>
