            <h3>Multiple reasons to not use generative AI for English:</h3>
            <p>- If you use it to <strong>generate ideas</strong>, this impairs your skills as a critical thinker, and researcher. It's important to be able to generate new ideas since ChatGPT can overlook things (it isn't very original, by definition), can be vague, and doesn't have access to all the content (ex. a book w/o an online copy, your personal stories, concept of current society and culture, non-public research, anything beyond its update year). It is best to practice doing this yourself and not relying on GPT, even if right now it seems to get the job done.</p>
            <p>- If you use it to <strong>understand text</strong>, I wouldn't suggest it unless you are really struggling. Reading comprehension is a skill I overlooked, and it is hard to learn it right before SAT. Learning to see clues AND being able to do it fast is something you have to practice. This will be especially important for your junior year (AP Lang) where you will have to analyze text (&amp; generate ideas!) <em>often</em> in a short amount of time and write an analysis essay on it. That said, you can use it cautiously, but smartly: I'd suggest asking ChatGPT to highlight clues and phrases to help you <em>learn</em> what to look out for.</p>
            <p>- If you use it to <strong>write sentences</strong>, you will learn less about writing. This includes grammar skills and spelling, but more importantly, VOICE! Your unique style of writing will develop less, and ChatGPT's style is actually really obvious, and VERY dull. "Using ChatGPT can sometimes hinder my writing voice by introducing a more generic tone that may overshadow my unique style and personal expression."</p>
            <p>- I remember Mr. Ngyuen saying he notices <strong>improvements in writing</strong> over the year. If he doesn't see that, you're likely to get a worse grade. Also, it makes it less enjoyable to be a teacher. Imagine reading 5 essays with the same tone and same, generic ideas. If everyone used it, this scenario is basically guaranteed. A mad teacher often means less tolerance on your sweet GPA.</p>
            <p>- It is easy to get caught, especially if you don't rephrase enough. Understand the importance of <strong>academic integrity</strong>! Teachers talk to each other, and those teachers will give you grades and write your recommendation letters. Not a good look, caused by an easily preventable act.</p>
            <p>Simply put, it just makes you a bad writer. And being a good writer, clear communicator, and observer will come in useful for anything you do later on (not only for English class, but for research papers and college apps etc.). Also helps you think faster + more overall!</p>
            <p>By the way, when you are using it for other classes, make sure they don't directly create content (especially when fact checking is important, like in history), and keep in mind it sucks at doing calculus &amp; chemistry once the topics get harder.</p>
            
            <h3>How to use ChatGPT properly:</h3>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>For repetitive, boring tasks</strong><br> "Convert the content of this .docx file into a clean html document"</li>
            <li><strong>MAKE ADJUSTMENTS</strong>
            <ul>
            <li>For some reason, it often adds more than you asked for (ex: I didn't ask it to style the file)</li>
            <li>OR it doesn't add all you need (ex: didn't add the header of my website to the html file)</li>
            <li>Change what it uses (ex: used &lt;strong&gt; instead of &lt;p&gt; for no reason)</li>
            <li>TIP: you can ask it again to make adjustments if they are repetitive ones</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
                <li><strong>To explain things</strong> <br>
                    "Explain why Bell's theorem goes against determinism"<br>
                    "Prove the quadratic formula"<br>
                    "Why is the answer to this question 2 and not 3? ____"<br>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>For vocab + grammar</strong> <br>
                    "Find me a word between running and hurrying" (Note: don't <em>only</em> rely on gpt for this) <br>
                        "Check for punctuation errors"<br>
                        "Teach me the difference between hyphen and dashes"<br>
                        "Do you understand what this sentence is trying to convey?: ___"
                </li>
            </ul>
                
            <ul>
            <li><strong>To get an overview</strong> <br>
                "List me the important events that led up to the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in WWI"
            </li>
            </ul>
            
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Check credibility</strong>
            <ul>
            <li>Did it hallucinate this? Is this correct information?</li>
            <li>What year is this information from? What version of JSON is it using?</li>
            <li>Has our knowledge of this information changed over the years?</li>
            <li>Is the source it used from Reddit? (it can be!)</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
            

            <h3>Remember:</h3>
            <p>"Education is not the learning of facts, but the training of the mind to think."</p>
            <ul><p class=".indented-text">- Einstein</p></ul>
           
            <p>If you rely on gpt to do the thinking for you, that ruins the purpose of school.</p>
