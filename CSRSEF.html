            <h2>FAQ</h2>
            <h3>Should I do CSRSEF?</h3>
            <p>Here are some questions to consider:
                <ul id="question">
                    <li>What kind of project do I want to do?</li>
                    <p>Computational, data analysis, or more hands on biology or engineering? These will change how much time you need to invest.</p>
                    <li>Do you have time?</li>
                    <p>If you are bad at managing your time or keeping yourself accountable on your own, this may not be for you. If you are not taking Independent Research, you will be very busy with other classes, and get significantly less check-ins/ time to work. Resources will still be provided, but often times the psych channel's CSRSEF channel gets neglected...</p>
                    <li>Do you like research, or learning new things?</li>
                    <p>If so, this is a great opportunity! </p>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>I want psychology, but no CSRSEF.</h3>
            <p>That's an option! Just talk to Mrs. Allender, or your counselor.</p>

            <h3>How do I even start? What do I do during the summer?</h3>
            <p>If the <a href="https://resources.finalsite.net/images/v1719333404/lwsdorg/fgyubyi0mykutuoxsxxc/APPsychCSRSEF-2024summerassignment.pdf">summer assignment</a> was a bit unclear, I understand. Here's what you should do:
                <ul id="question">
                    <li>Think about what you want to research or try</li>
                    <p>Find your research question. Nearly all the steps come after this. You can change it later on, but if you completely change fields, it may get harder for you to catch up.</p>
                    <p>Make sure your research question is 1) unique and interesting (novel, not researched before) 2) has high potential for impact (makes it easier to explain importance) 3) you can back up why you think your research will work with scientific articles 4) something you are willing to research about</p>
                    
                    <li>You can also design/build something!</li>
                    <p>There are two things you can do: an experiment, or building a prototype/mathematical model that you test. Either way, you will need research, but the process is different when you actually start doing it.</p>

                    <li>Find a mentor, and start emailing</li>
                    <p>Research people that has done research similar to your field. They don't have to live near you, and can provide assistance with your procedure or research paper remotely. Just keep in mind that if you are doing a lab experiment, you will need someone to monitor you (and sign forms). You can also have teachers or people you know as mentors.</p>

                    <li>Find a lab (for bio experiments)</li>
                    <p>Important! This can come with a mentor, but sometimes doesn't. This process can be difficult, and if the Bio Safety Level of Mr. Boyd's lab isn't enough, you will need to find somewhere else. Keep in mind that your mentor (unless they work at TSTEM) can't enter the school to help you.</p>

                    <li>Start researching</li>
                    <p>Especially for scientific projects: make THOROUGH research. Has this been done before? Are there different methods to what I want to do, and which one is the best method? What are different ways to do this experiment?</p>
                
                    <li>Don't worry too much</li>
                    <p>You don't have to finish your project over the summer, don't worry. Especially in IR (independent research), you typically have until January to find a mentor, lab, and have your research plan approved. Just make sure to keep an eye on how much time you need for the actual experiment, <span style="font-weight: bold;">since for some projects, you can't even start until your research plan is approved.</span></p>
